# Visual-Novel-Demo

## Description

This is a simple Godot project that was created by me and my friend Angelo Garcia for the art. It focuses mainly on UI design and sound effects over game play features.

## Usage

To test the demo, it is only necessary to download the Demo.exe file and run it.

## Dependancies

User must install the Godot Engine running on 3.5 to edit files. Additionally you must install the Dialogic Addon to test the dialogue features. To use the demo, the user must be operating on windows.
